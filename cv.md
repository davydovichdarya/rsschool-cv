## About me
I am 3-year student of BSU, Faculty of International Relations. In my school years, I already started to be interested in programming, after that I took courses in marketing and web design, where I was attracted by website development. I taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.

My priority is to do everything with high quality, so I signed up for RS School courses in order to master the new profession of Front-end developer in a structured and high-quality way.

At the moment, my goal is to advance to the Junior Front-end developer. In my work, I first of all appreciate the opportunity to grow up the career ladder.
Among my strengths, I can single out perseverance, patience and attentiveness. I also learn new material easily, so I'm always open to new suggestions and opportunities to learn new things.

Unfortunately, I have no experience in Front-end development. But I strive to learn new information and apply it in practice.
